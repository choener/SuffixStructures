[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/choener/SuffixStructures.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/choener/SuffixStructures)

A collection of suffix structures. While we currently only provide a naive

up to around 100M characters -- assuming the input sequence is well behaved in
some sense.
